# Time-Series-Feature-Extraction-Human-Activity-Recognition
This project focuses on extracting meaningful time-domain features from multivariate time-series sensor data to classify different human activities. The dataset is derived from the AReM (Activity Recognition system based on Multisensor data fusion) dataset provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
